# vue-test

> A test project trying out the use of Vue and vue-material.

So far i think i kind of miss react, but i guess Vue has it's perks with templates.  But i would probably be more comfortable if it was a tad more like React. I also don't like the .vue files since vim doesn't like them(even with the vim-vue plugin). I can buy the idea of having styles & html in one file and JS in another but having the JS within script-tags? Mixed with HTML & CSS? No.

Ecosystem so far is great. Vue-cli is awesome, so is vue-devtools. vue-material & vue-router are just so simple to use too.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```
